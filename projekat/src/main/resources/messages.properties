# ABOUT US

aboutUs.history=The history of our store
aboutUs.vinyls=vinyls
aboutUs.date=- Jan 9, 2009
aboutUs.textPt1=Our mission is help people explore, experience, and enjoy music on a deeper level. A tall order, maybe, but it's what gets us out of bed every morning with a thunderous shout. We do that both by sending you great music every month and by making sure you have a ton of fun each step of the way. Music is important, and so are you, and we work our asses off to make sure we do good by both.
aboutUs.textPt2=We believe in the power of the album as an art form. That music is a form of connection. That an album isn't just something you own, but something that becomes a part of you. And we offer a full sensory experience that encourages you to deeply connect with the music you're listening to. Vinyl is a tangible representation of the music you love, and brings with it a ritual you shouldn't live without. What you listen to and how you listen to it matters. It ends up being an essential part of who you are.
aboutUs.quote="It's like record store day with free shipping and no line"
aboutUs.source=- Cool Material
aboutUs.textPt3=Our team is made up of people just like you. Regular folks who think music is one of the most incredible things humanity has ever come up with. And we're committed to giving you the kind of experience that lives up to the records we're sending you. That's what this is all about after all. Discovering incredible records in incredible ways, month in and month out. And if that sounds like something you could get into, we'd love to have you join our growing worldwide family. If you need a little convincing first, go ahead and check out our archive. We'll be here when you get back.

# CONTACT-FAQ
#

contact.q1=When should I replace my needle/stylus?
contact.a1=There's a lot of active discussion and opinions on this topic, but the short answer is, it depends. Asking how long a record stylus will last is much like asking how long a set of strings will last on a guitar. There are many factors that influence the life of a stylus, from the condition of your records to the quality and material of the stylus, and much more. Either way, a worn stylus will damage records, so you definitely want to maintain it well and replace it regularly.
contact.q2=What is a turntable pre-amp and why do I need one?
contact.a2=Records are recorded with the bass frequencies reduced, and the high frequencies boosted to keep groove dimensions small. A phono pre-amp boosts bass frequencies and reduces high frequencies in an attempt to restore - as close as possible - the frequency response of the master recording.
contact.q3=How can dust affect records?
contact.a3=Needless to say, dust is a fact of life when it comes to vinyl records. A few basic vinyl maintenance principles are usually enough to keep things under control, however, left unchecked, dust can cause real damage to both your stylus and records. Not only does it contribute to pops and crackles, but it can also lead to the needle jumping, and even stylus and record wear.
contact.q4=So what's all the fuss about 180g?
contact.a4=The benefit of thicker weight vinyl are mostly twofold: 1) They're more satisfying to handle - more substantial, and 2) They're more resilient to damage over time, including breakage and warping. In addition, many argue heavier grade vinyl provides a more stable platform for your stylus and cantilever whilst also better isolating the stylus from unwanted vibration.
contact.q5=Are vinyl records better when sourced from the original master tapes?
contact.a5=This is a BIG question. But in essence, it's the mastering process and the quality of source material that matters most. The deficiencies attributed to digital may have had some relevance in the early days, but not now. Almost everything these days is recorded and mixed digitally, and so long as digital files are handled with care, there is no reason why digital source files pressed to vinyl can't shine through. There is, however, a lot of valid criticism in vinyl records cut from heavily compressed digital masters, which just sound diminished on vinyl rather than open, dynamic and loud. Our conversations with well-known industry mastering engineers appear to back this theory up.
